While using Expo CLI, I encountered a peculiar issue where the development server would randomly terminate, displaying no specific error messages in the terminal. This behavior was inconsistent; sometimes it would run for hours without problems, other times it would crash within minutes.  The app itself seemed to function correctly when it was running, indicating the problem was with the development server itself rather than the code.
