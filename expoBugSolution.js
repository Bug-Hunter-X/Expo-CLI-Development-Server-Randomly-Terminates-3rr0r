While a definitive solution requires identifying the root cause, some potential workarounds include:

1. **Increasing System Resources:** Ensure your system has sufficient memory and CPU resources available. Close unnecessary applications to free up resources.
2. **Restarting the Development Server:** If the server crashes, simply restart it using `expo start`.
3. **Checking for Conflicting Packages:** Review your `package.json` file for potential conflicting packages.  Try updating or removing unnecessary dependencies. 
4. **Updating Expo CLI:** Make sure you're running the latest version of Expo CLI by executing `expo upgrade`.
5. **Checking System Logs:** Examine your system's logs (e.g., Windows Event Viewer, macOS Console) for any additional information that might provide clues about the cause of the crashes.  

This is a temporary fix. A better solution would be to determine the root cause and apply the correct fix.
